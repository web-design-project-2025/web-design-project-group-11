JOURNEE
-
A travel inspiration website for users to find their deam Journee.

DESCRIPTION:
- 
Journee is a website designed and developed by Ronja Str√∂berg, Sophia Vilhelmsson och Hannah Karlsson. 
The purpose of Journee is to help users/travellers find inspiration on where to travel to next and explore new potential dream destinations.
On Journee we have gathered the most popular destinations in Europe and Asia in one place. 
With Journee we wanted to create a minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing website that invites and inspire our users. 
We wanted to challenge ourselves in the design and the features, to create something we had not done before.

FEATURES:
- 
- Fetching real time Weather Data from OpenMeteo API, so that the users can know the current temperature in all capital cities.
- Responsive design, working well from desktop all the way down to mobile screen sizes.
- Fetching all the data about the continents and the destinations through JSON-files, making it easy to continue to developing the website if wanted, adding even more continentss for the users of Journee to explore.
- Like-features allowing the users to like their favorite destinations and save them to go back to look at later. The like feature also includes local storage, making sure the saved destinations are still there when wanted.
- A form on the contact page where users can contact us if they want. The form includes form validation, making sure the users know how to fill it out correctly. 

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
-
Through the development of Journee, we have worked with GitHub and multiple branches. We have one production branch where the final version of the website is distributed. Additionally we have one main branch which is the live version of the code and from the main branch we have created multiple feature branches and bug fix branches to keep the structure nice and clear. Every once in a while when a new feature is done and works as we would like it we have merged these branches back to main, making sure the main branch always has a working version of the website.
